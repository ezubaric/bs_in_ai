\item \textbf{Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations I (Honors) (MATH 340)}: This is the first semester of the two-semester honors sequence Math 340-341 which gives a unified and enriched treatment of multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations, with supplementary material from differential geometry, Fourier series and calculus of variations.
\item \textbf{Calculus I (MATH 140)}: Introduction to calculus, including functions, limits, continuity, derivatives and applications of the derivative, sketching of graphs of functions, introduction to definite and indefinite integrals, and calculation of area. The course is especially recommended for science and mathematics majors. Credit will be granted for only one of the following: MATH 140 or MATH 136 or MATH 120.
\item \textbf{Calculus II (MATH 141)}: Continuation of MATH140, including techniques of integration, improper integrals, applications of integration (such as volumes, work, arc length, moments), inverse functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, sequences and series.
\item \textbf{Discrete Structures (CMSC 250)}: Fundamental mathematical concepts related to computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations, functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science. Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees with selected applications.
\item \textbf{Discrete Mathematics (DATA 250)}
\item \textbf{AI and Ethics (PHIL 211)}: An introduction to a major subfield of contemporary Philosophy, namely applied ethics, and the experience of using some major tools in the practice of philosophy more generally, namely, the construction and formal evaluation of arguments, conceptual analysis, the use of thought experiments, and clear, direct and persuasive writing. Learning how to execute the latter will involve an intense iterative process.
The substantive focus of the course will be the ethical evaluation of AI in some of its current and potentially future incarnations. Weâ€™ll examine algorithmic opacity, algorithmic bias
and decision-making, autonomous weapons systems, human-robot interaction, and artificial
moral agents, in order to uncover what, if any, ethical issues they give rise to.

\item \textbf{Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations II (MATH 341)}: This course is a continuation of MATH 340. The honors sequence MATH 340-341 covers roughly the same material of MATH 240, 241, and 246, but in greater depth and rigor. This semeseter will begin with remaining material from Multivariable Calculus (MATH 241) on extrema of functions of several variables and Lagrange multipliers. The remainder of the semester, and the bulk of the course, is then devoted to the theory of Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH 246).
\item \textbf{Designing Fair Systems (INST 204)}: Reviews how specific values are built into different automated decision-making systems as an inevitable result of constructing mechanisms meant to produce specific outcomes. These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.
\item \textbf{Meaning through Language: Why are we so good at it?  (LING 260)}: What is it about us humans and our languages that allows us to communicate in ways unmatched by other animals or powerful AI models? The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics.
\item \textbf{Data Science Techniques (INST 414)}: An exploration of how to extract insights from large-scale datasets. The course will cover the complete analytical funnel from data extraction and cleaning to data analysis and insights interpretation and visualization. The data analysis component will focus on techniques in both supervised and unsupervised learning to extract information from datasets. Topics will include clustering, classification, and regression techniques. Through homework assignments, a project, exams and in-class activities, students will practice working with these techniques and tools to extract relevant information from structured and unstructured data.
