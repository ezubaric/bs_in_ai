\item \textbf{nan (MATH 461)}: The course provides an introduction to linear algebra and matrix theory. It is intended primarily for engineering students. This course cannot be used toward the upper level math requirements for MATH/STAT majors. Credit will be granted for only one of the following: MATH 240, MATH 341, or MATH 461.
\item \textbf{nan (DATA 250)}:  Introduction to basic discrete mathematical and linear algebraic structures and use of these mathematical structures to solve programming problems. Logic, set theory, formal proof methodology, functions, and basic linear algebra.

\item \textbf{nan (MATH 341)}: This course is a continuation of MATH 340. The honors sequence MATH 340-341 covers roughly the same material of MATH 240, 241, and 246, but in greater depth and rigor. This semeseter will begin with remaining material from Multivariable Calculus (MATH 241) on extrema of functions of several variables and Lagrange multipliers. The remainder of the semester, and the bulk of the course, is then devoted to the theory of Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH 246).
\item \textbf{nan (INST 204)}: Reviews how specific values are built into different automated decision-making systems as an inevitable result of constructing mechanisms meant to produce specific outcomes. These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.
\item \textbf{nan (LING 260)}: What is it about us humans and our languages that allows us to communicate in ways unmatched by other animals or powerful AI models? The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics.
\item \textbf{nan (INST 414)}: An exploration of how to extract insights from large-scale datasets. The course will cover the complete analytical funnel from data extraction and cleaning to data analysis and insights interpretation and visualization. The data analysis component will focus on techniques in both supervised and unsupervised learning to extract information from datasets. Topics will include clustering, classification, and regression techniques. Through homework assignments, a project, exams and in-class activities, students will practice working with these techniques and tools to extract relevant information from structured and unstructured data.
\item \textbf{nan (CMSC 320)}: An introduction to the data science pipeline, i.e., the end-to-end process of going from unstructured, messy data to knowledge and actionable insights. Provides a broad overview of several topics including statistical data analysis, basic data mining and machine learning algorithms, large-scale data management, cloud computing, and information visualization.

Additional topics may include: semantics, pragmatics, language change, writing systems, typology, language universals, comparison with other communication systems.
\item \textbf{Language and Mind (LING 240)}: The study of language as a cognitive phenomenon. Ways of representing people's knowledge of their native language, ways in which that knowledge is attained naturally by children, and how it is used in speaking and listening.

\item \textbf{Syntax I (LING 311)}: Basic concepts, analytical techniques of generative syntax, relation to empirical limits imposed by viewing grammars as representations of a component of human mind. Aspects of current theories.
