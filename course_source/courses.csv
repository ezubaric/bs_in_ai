In the first experiment, students perform a simple servomechanism experiment, where students control a single joint of a robot. We vary the weight on the movable rod to simulate the effects of the changing inertia due to outer segments moving. Next, we have the students directly control several joints of a robot arm. The third experiment is to control the position and orientation of the end effector. A fourth experiment deals with grasping. A fifth experiment deals with the position and orientation of a wheeled robot. ",,,1,ENG,3,EXT,0.2,,,,,ENG_EXT_Existing_3
RoboticsRequired,CMSC 477,Robotics Perception and Planning,Existing,YES,"This course teaches the fundamentals of robot perception and robot path planning. The syllabus and course is divided into two segments, as per the major aspects involved in robotics. There will be lectures on (a) planning and control and (b) perception, with projects and homework. The syllabus includes the following: Motion Planning Introduction, Rigid Body Transformations, Velocity, Velocity Dynamics, Vehicle Controls, Graph Based Planning, Sampling Based Planning, Trajectory Planning, Navigation, Baeyesian and Kalman Filtering, Camera Model and Calibration, Projective Geometry, Visual Perception features, Optical Flow, Pose Estimation, 3D Velocities, Basics of Machine Learning, Structure from Motion, Visual Odometry, and Recognition and Learning. There are two examinations, 3 projects in multiple phases, and two homeworks. The class uses robots, mobile platforms with sensors and effectors. Drone experiments are done in simulation or in the Iribe Drone Lab, space permitting.",,,1,CS,3,TTK,0.2,,,,,CS_TTK_Existing_3
RoboticsRequired,ENEE 467,Robotics Project Laboratory,Existing,YES,"This practical robotics class teaches practical skills to build, control, and deploy robotic systems. Interdisciplinary groups of students develop real-world robotic systems. The first 10 weeks of the lab are devoted to 5 pre-programmed experiments. The remainder of the lab is devoted to student projects. Students work in teams of 2, preferably with each student coming from a different background in engineering. There are 2 weekly lectures. The emphasis of the class is entirely on making a real robot do what you want it to do. In the first experiment, students perform a simple servomechanism experiment, where students control a single joint of a robot. We vary the weight on the movable rod to simulate the effects of the changing inertia due to outer segments moving. Next, we have the students directly control several joints of a robot arm.
