Ethics,PHIL 211,,Shared,YES,"An introduction to a major subfield of contemporary Philosophy, namely applied ethics, and the experience of using some major tools in the practice of philosophy more generally, namely, the construction and formal evaluation of arguments, conceptual analysis, the use of thought experiments, and clear, direct and persuasive writing. Learning how to execute the latter will involve an intense iterative process.
The substantive focus of the course will be the ethical evaluation of AI in some of its current and potentially future incarnations. We’ll examine algorithmic opacity, algorithmic bias

Fairness,INST 204,,New,YES,"Reviews how specific values are built into different automated decision-making systems as an inevitable result of constructing mechanisms meant to produce specific outcomes. These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.",,
Language,LING 260,,Existing,YES,"What is it about us humans and our languages that allows us to communicate in ways unmatched by other animals or powerful AI models? The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics.",,

Compgraphs,BSAI 216,Efficient Systems for AI Applications,"New,Required",YES,"This course introduces students to the computer system fundamentals that underpin AI systems.  Students learn how memory and parameters are organized in low-level systems and the programming techniques necessary to effeciently update those parameters on large datasets.  Students also learn how the mathematical fundamentals of AI algorithms are translated into learned parameters given large datasets.  Finally, students learn how modern algorithms update those parameters effeciently with large datasets that exceed the capacity of individual computers.","Would introduce a lower-level language (most likely C, barring a Rusty sea change) and memory management (most likely for GPU).  They would also need to learn how to abstract these concepts into a computation graph with automatic differentiation (assuming this remains the primary paradigm for AI moving forward).  If not, the course would need to be updated to reflect this.  The description is meant to reflect this with sufficient abstraction to cover changes in the short to medium term.  To ensure the course description is future-proofed (as much as possible), I gave myself the exercise of making sure it would work as a description both for what I'm currently thinking of and for the 2010 course I taught on using MapReduce to learn (what we thought at the time) were n-gram large language models.  

One thing I'm not overjoyed about is that we'd almost certainly have to use CUDA, which is fairly proprietary.  But I don't see a viable alternative.",

GenAIRequired,AI 220,Measuring Preferences and Rankings,New,YES,"A key component of modern AI systems is knowing when one AI system (or its output) is better than another.  Many of the mathematical tools used to make these decisions come from psychology.

Students learn how to search over structured representations to find optimal solutions to planning problems, how to represent real-world problems in graph structures or game trees, and how to represent and solve AI problems using first-order logic.","This course covers much of the same content as 421.  Students would have the option of taking either (and we'd share this course with the BA).  However, it wouldn't be as difficult (or as deep as) 421.  Students wouldn't be able to get credit for both.",

Neural,AI 222,,New,YES,"This course presents the foundational algorithms of using data to learn algorithms and representations to solve real-world problems.

After establishing the fundamentals of byte-level representation and how different languages are represented on a computer, the course discusses the type / token distinction of word use and how this is reflected in computational representations of language and how this is complicated by languages with implicit or ambiguous tokenization.  Finally, this course covers the application of large models (taken as a given) and resources to novel tasks or in novel combinations: how to adapt existing resources to new tasks, how to evaluate how well the models perform, and how to efficiently adapt models to these tasks.
