We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning?

Compgraphs,AI 216,Efficient Systems for AI Applications,New,YES,"This course introduces students to the computer system fundamentals that underpin AI systems.  Students learn how memory and parameters are organized in low-level systems and the programming techniques necessary to effeciently update those parameters on large datasets.  Students also learn how the mathematical fundamentals of AI algorithms are translated into learned parameters given large datasets.  Finally, students learn how modern algorithms update those parameters effeciently with large datasets that exceed the capacity of individual computers.","Would introduce a lower-level language (most likely C, barring a Rusty sea change) and memory management (most likely for GPU).  They would also need to learn how to abstract these concepts into a computation graph with automatic differentiation (assuming this remains the primary paradigm for AI moving forward).  If not, the course would need to be updated to reflect this.  The description is meant to reflect this with sufficient abstraction to cover changes in the short to medium term.  To ensure the course description is future-proofed (as much as possible), I gave myself the exercise of making sure it would work as a description both for what I'm currently thinking of and for the 2010 course I taught on using MapReduce to learn (what we thought at the time) were n-gram large language models.  

One thing I'm not overjoyed about is that we'd almost certainly have to use CUDA, which is fairly proprietary.  But I don't see a viable alternative.",
