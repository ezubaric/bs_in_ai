Programming1,CMSC 141,,Refocus,YES,"This course is an introduction to computing and programming through the lens of data. It aims to give you ways of thinking about solving problems using computation. Students will learn to write programs to process both tabular and structured data, to assess programs both experimentally and theoretically, to apply basic data science concepts, and to discuss big ideas around the communication, use, and social impacts of digital information.",https://dcic-world.org/2022-01-25/index.html,
Programming2,CMSC 142,,Refocus,YES,"This course explains the concepts and techniques required to write programs that can handle large amounts of data efficiently. Project-oriented and classroom-tested, it presents a number of important algorithms—supported by motivating examples—that bring meaning to the problems faced by computer programmers. The idea of computational complexity is introduced, demonstrating what can and cannot be computed efficiently at scale, helping programmers make informed judgements about the algorithms they use.

Students completing only Math 340 with a grade of C or better will satisfy the math degree requirement for Math 241 and may not also receive credit for Math 241. Math majors may not use 340-341 to satisfy any upper-division requirement.",

This semeseter will begin with remaining material from Multivariable Calculus (MATH 241) on extrema of functions of several variables and Lagrange multipliers. The remainder of the semester, and the bulk of the course, is then devoted to the theory of Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH 246).",,

Fairness,INST 204,,New,,"Reviews how specific values are built into different automated decision-making systems as an inevitable result of constructing mechanisms meant to produce specific outcomes. These values create differential outcomes for the different people enmeshed in these systems, but both these values and these systems can be changed to support different values and different outcomes. The class serves as an introduction to the emerging field of algorithmic bias that bridges the disciplines of information science, computer science, law, policy, philosophy, sociology, urban planning, and others.",,

"Sampler1,Sampler2",AI 102,Introduction to AI and the Law,"New,Sampler",YES,"This course will examine AI Law and Regulation from the perspective of US Law and industry self-regulation with some discussion of select relevant international law and voluntary frameworks (i.e., EU AI Act and ISO/UN/OECD). Specific topics of US and international law may include: American Legal Process and Procedure, Administrative Law for AI Regulation, Constitutional Law Relationships to AI, Intellectual Property Law (Copyright, Trademark, Patent, and Trade Secret Law), Negligence/Products Liability Law, Privacy Law and Privacy Torts, Fundamentals of Contract Law, Industry Self-Regulation and International Frameworks.",,
"Sampler1,Sampler2",AI 103,Introduction to AI and Food,"New,Sampler",YES,"This course will examine the role of AI in American Food.  From how chemical synthesis driven by AI can produce new fertilizers, insecticides, and other tools that can improve the yield and productivity of crops, to using computer vision to monitor livestock, to harvesting crops with robotic agents, this course will explore the role of AI in food production.  Next, the course will cover the role of AI in food storage, transportation, and its trade on commodities markets.  Finally, the course will end with an overview of AI in food preparation, marketing, and helping individuals making nutritional decisions.",,

Compgraph,BSAI 216,Efficient Systems for AI Applications,"New,Required",,"This course introduces students to the computer system fundamentals that underpin AI systems.  Students learn how memory and parameters are organized in low-level systems and the programming techniques necessary to effeciently update those parameters on large datasets.  Students also learn how the mathematical fundamentals of AI algorithms are translated into learned parameters given large datasets.  Finally, students learn how modern algorithms update those parameters effeciently with large datasets that exceed the capacity of individual computers.","Would introduce a lower-level language (most likely C, barring a Rusty sea change) and memory management (most likely for GPU).  They would also need to learn how to abstract these concepts into a computation graph with automatic differentiation (assuming this remains the primary paradigm for AI moving forward).  If not, the course would need to be updated to reflect this.  The description is meant to reflect this with sufficient abstraction to cover changes in the short to medium term.  To ensure the course description is future-proofed (as much as possible), I gave myself the exercise of making sure it would work as a description both for what I'm currently thinking of and for the 2010 course I taught on using MapReduce to learn (what we thought at the time) were n-gram large language models.  

One thing I'm not overjoyed about is that we'd almost certainly have to use CUDA, which is fairly proprietary.  But I don't see a viable alternative.",

Zermelo,AI 220,Measuring Preferences and Rankings,New,,"A key component of modern AI systems is knowing when one AI system (or its output) is better than another.  Many of the mathematical tools used to make these decisions come from psychology.  This course introduces the mathematical tools that form the foundation of these techniques, teaches students to fit these models to data, and then explains how these models are used in modern AI systems and in AI evaluations.",,

It introduces the historical analogs of AI (e.g., the upheaval of mechanize agricultural, assembly lines, and information technologies) and compares and contrasts how AI is different.  It provides a non-technical history of the major AI developments of the last hundred years and introduces to societal, ethical, economic, and technical questions that are a part of the AI moment.",,

Gofai,AI 221,Classical AI Algorithms,New,YES,"This course introduces the foundation of AI theory and practice.  Students learn how to search over structured representations to find optimal solutions to planning problems, how to represent real-world problems in graph structures or game trees, and how to represent and solve AI problems using first-order logic.","This course covers much of the same content as 421.  Students would have the option of taking either (and we'd share this course with the BA).  However, it wouldn't be as difficult (or as deep as) 421.  Students wouldn't be able to get credit for both.",
Gofai,CMSC 421,,Existing,,"Introduces a range of ideas and methods in AI, varying semester to semester but chosen largely from: automated heuristic search, planning, games, knowledge representation, logical and statistical inference, learning, natural language processing, vision, robotics, cognitive modeling, and intelligent agents. Programming projects will help students obtain a hands-on feel for various topics.","This seems fine to maintain as is, given 221 is another option.",Prerequisite: Minimum grade of C- in CMSC351 and CMSC330; and permission of CMNS-Computer Science department.

GenAIRequired,BSAI 270,Multilingual Text Processing,New,YES,"This course covers the representation and manipulation of linguistic data on computers.  After establishing the fundamentals of byte-level representation and how different languages are represented on a computer, the course discusses the type / token distinction of word use and how this is reflected in computational representations of language and how this is complicated by languages with implicit or ambiguous tokenization.  Finally, the course ends with a review of the lexicosemantic resources available for the words languges.",,

This course covers the application of large models and resources to novel tasks or in novel combinations: how to adapt existing resources to new tasks, how to evaluate how well the models perform, and how to efficiently adapt models to these tasks.  ","In 2024, this would look like adaptation (LoRA), prompting, using offline models vs. APIs, etc.  Obviously the course description needs to be more general so that it doesn't get too stale.",
