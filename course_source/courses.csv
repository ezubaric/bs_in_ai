AccessibleElectives,AMST 320,(Dis)ability in American Film,Existing,,"Explores the connection between film and disability through an analysis of independent and mainstream American films in various film genres. Specifically, we will consider how these film representations reflect and/or challenge the shifting social perspectives of disability over the 20th and 21st centuries. Beginning with the presentation of disability as theatrical spectacle in the traveling sideshow and early cinema, we will work our way through film history to develop an understanding of our society's complicated relationship with disability.",,,,,,,0.064,,,,,,,,,,,,
AccessibleElectives,\prefix{} 431,AI and UX,Shared,,The purpose of this course is to teach undergraduate and graduate students how and when to integrate AI-assisted search and validation procedures into their information seeking practices. The course could also be designed to provide UMD with opportunities to collect search results data from low tech student assignments using the AI assisted search engines. Comparing search results year on year could enable researchers to monitor tools as they evolve. The course will also teach students to  compare the information retrieval capabilities of standard search engines to the AI tools and monitor the evolution of both over the semesters.,,,1,INFO,4,EXT,0.064,,,,,INFO_EXT_New_4,0,0,0,0,13,19,19
