\subsection{Library Assessment}

Requested and expected on January 24, 2025.

\subsection{Physical Facilities}

Short term, most of the instruction will take place in Iribe or the Computer Science Instructional Center (CSIC).  However, a long term plan is for the construction of a new AI-centered building that will house many of the AI-specific courses (although courses shared with CS will remain in Iribe or CSIC).

\subsection{Instructional Resources}

\aim{} is currently recruiting \ttkfaculty{} TTK faculty, most of whom will be teaching in this program or the BA in AI program.  In addition, we have requested \ptkfaculty{} lines, who will primarily teach the introduction to programming course and the systems and programming languages for automatic optimization of AI models course and to bolster the staffing in the courses shared with with computer science.

In addition, we are requesting \$\upfrontcluster{} for expanding the existing Nexus cluster for instructional needs and \$\continuingcluster{} per year to maintain the cluster.  This will:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Provide ObjectStore storage for course projects and interdisciplinary collaboration
    \item Serve locally tuned AI models for applications across the university
    \item Provide GPU allocations for courses to provide instruction on how to develop AI models
    \item Provide CPU allocations for data prepossessing
\end{itemize*}

Because not all models can be run or trained locally, we are also requesting \$\cloud{} for students to run cloud-based models through the university's existing agreements through providers such as Amazon, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

\subsection{Administrative and Advising Resources}

In conjunction with the BA in AI, We are requesting \admin{} positions and \advisors{} advisors, who will be shared with the BA in AI program.
