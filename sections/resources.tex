\subsection{Library Assessment}

Attached in full at end of this document.

\subsection{Physical Facilities}

Short term, most of the instruction will take place in Iribe or the Computer Science Instructional Center (CSIC).  However, a long term plan is for the construction of a new AI-centered building that will house many of the AI-specific courses (although courses shared with CS will remain in Iribe or CSIC).

\subsection{Instructional Resources}



For the next calendar year, \aim{} is currently recruiting \ttkfaculty{} TTK faculty, most of whom will be teaching in this program or \abr{ba} in \abr{ai} program (in conjunction with teaching requirements in their tenure home units) future years will hire additional faculty.  In addition, we have requested \abr{ptk} lines, who will primarily teach the introduction to programming course and the systems and programming languages for automatic optimization of AI models course and to bolster the staffing in the courses shared with with math and computer science.

Because the new program will increase enrollments across multiple units, we are also requesting additional support for teaching assistants to support the 1300 additional seats needed in courses in the first year rising to 3000 in the fifth year of the program.

In addition, we are requesting \$\upfrontcluster{} for expanding the existing Nexus cluster for instructional needs and \$\continuingcluster{} per year to maintain the cluster.  This will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide ObjectStore storage for course projects and interdisciplinary collaboration
    \item Serve locally tuned AI models for applications across the university
    \item Provide GPU allocations for courses to provide instruction on how to develop AI models
    \item Provide CPU allocations for data prepossessing
\end{itemize}

Because not all models can be run or trained locally, we are also requesting \$\cloud{} for students to run cloud-based models through the university's existing agreements through providers such as Amazon, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

\subsection{Administrative and Advising Resources}



In conjunction with the BA in AI, We are requesting one administrative position and \advisors{} advisors.  And a full-time technical staff member to coordinate technical resources.

\subsection{Financial Tables}

The full budgets are attached in CourseLeaf, but the summary of the anticipated expenditures are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:budget}.  These numbers are based on an assumption of \StudentsperSection{} students in a section and \StudentsperTA{} students per \abr{ta}.  We assume that \abr{ptk} faculty would teach on average \PTKLoad{} courses per year and that \abr{ttk} faculty would teach on average \TTKLoad{} courses per year.\footnote{This is an interdisciplinary program, and different units have different expectations, but this is based on an assumption that \abr{cs} faculty would teach more \abr{ai}-relevant courses than other units.}
