Artificial Intelligence is the study of creating computer systems that
learn from data and interactions to create systems that can reason,
generate text and images, and interact in ways that resemble humans.
%
\name{} (\short{}) is a highly technical program that trains
students to build new \ai{} systems and algorithms from the ground up, understand the
training of models from both a data and systems perspective, and then
use those techniques in interdisciplinary applications.
%
The first two years of the program develop a strong technical
foundation in programming and understanding the theory of statistical
learning, symbolic reasoning, and optimization.
%
The following two years focuses on deploying those techniques in
interdisciplinary applications enabling students build state-of-the-art \ai{} systems and also think critically
about the effective, ethical application of \ai{}.
