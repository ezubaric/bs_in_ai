\subsection*{Subject:}
Library Collection Assessment BS in Artificial Intelligence

\subsection*{Introduction}
We are providing this assessment in response to a proposal by the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM) in the Department of Computer Science to create a BS in Artificial Intelligence program. The Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM) asked that we at the University of Maryland Libraries assess our collection resources to determine how well the Libraries support the curriculum of this proposed program.

\subsection*{Serial Publications}
The University of Maryland Libraries currently subscribe to a large number of scholarly journals—almost all in online format—that focus on artificial intelligence.\\
The Libraries subscribe to most of the top-ranked journals that are listed in the Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence category in the 2023 Science Edition of Journal Citation Reports. These journals include the following, all of which are available online:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning
    \item IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
    \item Nature Machine Intelligence
    \item Information Fusion
    \item IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles
    \item IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation
    \item International Journal on Computer Vision
    \item IEEE Transactions on Image Processing
    \item IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems
    \item Medical Image Analysis
    \item Artificial Intelligence Review
    \item IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine
    \item IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
    \item IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing
    \item Energy and AI
\end{itemize}

The highly-ranked core journal to which the Libraries do not currently subscribe is \textit{Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning} published by Now Publisher. However, articles in journals that we do not own likely will be available through Interlibrary Loan/Document Delivery.\\
\textbf{AI research in general is very transparent}, and most publications are accessible to the general public without a subscription, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item NeurIPS - Neural Information Processing Systems
    \item JMLR - Journal of Machine Learning Research
    \item ACL Publications (EMNLP, ACL, NAACL, etc.)
    \item ICML - International Conference on Machine Learning
    \item UAI - Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence
    \item ICLR - International Conference on Learning Representations
    \item TACL - Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics
    \item CL - Computational Linguistics
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Databases}
The Libraries’ \href{https://lib.guides.umd.edu/az.php}{Database Finder} offers online access to databases that provide indexing and access to scholarly journal articles and other information sources. Relevant databases include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ACM
    \item IEEE Xplore
    \item Agricola
    \item Medline
    \item Philosopher's Index with Full Text
    \item ScienceDirect
    \item Multidisciplinary databases: Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, Web of Science
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Monographs}
The Libraries regularly acquire scholarly monographs in artificial intelligence and allied disciplines. A search of the University of Maryland Libraries’ UMD Discover catalog yielded sizable lists of citations of books that we own. Below is a sample of the results:

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Search Terms} & \textbf{UMD Holdings} & \textbf{Worldwide Holdings} \\
\hline
Artificial Intelligence OR AI & 30,791 & 874,094 \\
Artificial Intelligence OR AI AND ethic* & 15,687 & 165,503 \\
Artificial Intelligence OR AI AND irrigat* & 15,177 & 161,164 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{UMD Discover Advanced Sample Searches}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Conclusion}
With our journal holdings, monographs, and databases, as well as additional support services and resources, at this point in time, our assessment is that the University of Maryland Libraries are able to meet the curricular and research needs of the proposed BS in Artificial Intelligence.\\
However, given the challenges of resource inflation costs and finite budget allocation, the Libraries cannot guarantee that we will continue to have access to these resources in the near future.
