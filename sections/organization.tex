\bsaicommittee{The program will be administered jointly by computer science and \aim{}. There will be a staff Program Administrator who will report to the Program Director, and closely coordinate with the \aim{} Associate Director of Education.}

\csamend{A full-time Assistant Program Director for the proposed major will be responsible for administrative leadership of the program. In addition, there will be an academic advising team led by an Assistant Director. Finally, a technical staff member will coordinate technical resources including high performance computing. The Assistant Program Director and the Assistant Director for academic advising will be supervised by the Academic Director of the BS in AI. The technical staff will be supervised by appropriate AIM staff and coordinate with appropriate technical leadership of the Nexus cluster (currently part of \abr{umiacs}).}
