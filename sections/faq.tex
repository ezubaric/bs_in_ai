\question{Does DATA 250 provide enough of a foundation to satisfy both the linear algebra and discrete math requirements?}

\answer{Waiting on answer\dots}

\question{Will this be an \abr{lep}?}

\answer{Yes, the intention is to submit as an \abr{lep}, although this approval is in some ways parallel to the formal program approval track.}

\question{Why is there no statistics course?}

The committee identified three core skillsets from statistics which are already satisfied in other courses:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Regression: In multiple courses, most notably CMSC 320
    \item Statistical Tests: In the AI Measurement Course
    \item Inference: In the AI Foundation Course
\end{itemize*}

\question{What is the relationship between CMSC 221 and CMSC 421?  Are they duplicates?}

In the current proposal, we have currently split out the GOFAI course into a higher level one and a lower levelÂ one meant for people to take early on in the BS in AI program or as part of some other major.  This is analogous to how Math has a Linear Algebra course for non-majors and one for majors.

How this would actually be implemented is another question.  Perhaps shared lectures and different recitations and homeworks?  Or two completely different courses?  Bill Regli is revampling CMSC 421, and perhaps this could be part of a larger conversation.
