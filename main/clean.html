Summary</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence is a new undergraduate program based in The Department of Computer Science as a part of <SMALL>AIM</SMALL> that offers an interdisciplinary introduction to building artificial intelligence applications, connecting the theory enabling those applications to the practice of implementing systems that learn from data.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Description</A>
</H1>

<P>
Artificial Intelligence is the study of creating computer systems that
learn from data and interactions to create systems that can reason,
generate text and images, and interact in ways that resemble humans.
The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence (<SMALL>BSAI</SMALL>) is a highly technical program that trains
students to build new <SMALL>AI</SMALL> systems and algorithms from the ground up, understand the
training of models from both a data and systems perspective, and then
use those techniques in interdisciplinary applications.
The first two years of the program develop a strong technical
foundation in programming and understanding the theory of statistical
learning, symbolic reasoning, and optimization.
The following two years focuses on deploying those techniques in
interdisciplinary applications enabling students build state-of-the-art <SMALL>AI</SMALL> systems and also think critically
about the effective, ethical application of <SMALL>AI</SMALL>.

<P>
The <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will offer specializations in:

<UL>
<LI>Generative <SMALL>AI</SMALL>;
</LI>
<LI>AI Algorithms;
</LI>
<LI>Accessibility; and
      </LI>
<LI>AI, Society, and Decision Making

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Requirements</A>
</H1>

<P>
In listing requirements for the proposed program we use CSAI to
refer to all courses even those also developed for the BA in AI (which
uses the prefix HCAI) to
reduce confusion (e.g., we would envision these shared courses to be crosslisted).

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00071000000000000000">
Mission and Purpose</A>
</H2>

<P>
The goal of The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence is to train the next generation of innovators and builders of artificial intelligence technology to apply their expertise to help solve interdisciplinary problems in science and society.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00072000000000000000">
Educational Objectives</A>
</H2>

<P>
Currently at UMD, AI is often taught as an advanced subject requiring substantial prerequisites. In addition, <SMALL>AI</SMALL>-related coursework in the Computer Science department is significantly over-enrolled every semester, as are many of the AI and machine learning courses across other departments, including Math, the College of Information, Physics, Engineering, and others. 
To address this need&mdash;that reflects how <SMALL>AI</SMALL> is becoming a part of many disciplines across the university from analyzing polling data in Journalism to detecting irrigation issues from satellite imagery in Agriculture&mdash;the new <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will build on Maryland's existing strengths to  offer an integrated curriculum to expose students to AI starting with their introductory courses and then allowing them to gain depth and expertise within AI or building breadth by connecting AI across the campus. 

<P>
In addition to serving these communities, the introductory courses&mdash;foundations of <SMALL>AI</SMALL>, computation graphs, and <SMALL>AI</SMALL>-first introductions to programming&mdash;will offer exposure to both introductory programming and core competencies of working with and understanding AI even for students outside the key major (as these programs are gateway courses, they would not have the same restrictions later in the LEP major).  It will thus make AI learning accessible to a much larger student population in a curricular area that is in high demand.

<P>
Students with a BS in AI will be prepared for a variety of career paths, including AI developer, prompt engineer, dataset curator, data scientist, and AI-assisted content creator.  These AI skills will also be useful in application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, data science and analytics, user experience and design, robotics, business analytics, and geospatial reasoning. Students can also use their technical expertise to enter careers in policy, law, education, agriculture, or healthcare. Finally, our program will prepare students who want to continue their education and pursue an MS or PhD.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00073000000000000000">
Selective Admissions</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence will seek the approval of the campus enrollment management committee for designation as a limited enrollment program (LEP) at the University of Maryland, adhering to specific admission criteria to manage enrollment and maintain academic standards.
Because this program will be highly similar to the existing computer science program (which is oversubscribed), the LEP is necessary to prevent the new program from becoming overloaded.
The creation of the new program would help increase the total number of seats available for computational majors on campus, building on computer science.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00073100000000000000">
Freshman Admission</A>
</H3>
Prospective students applying as freshmen to the University of Maryland can indicate their interest in The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence on their general application. Admission to <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> is competitive and based on a holistic review of the applicant's academic record, co-curricular involvement, relevant research experience or personal projects, and any honors or awards. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00073200000000000000">
Transfer Admission</A>
</H3>
Transfer students one course from each of the following sets of Gateway courses with a minimum grade of B- before applying (e.g., CMSC 131 from requirement 1, CMSC 142 from requirement 2, and MATH 140 from requirement 3):

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CMSC141</SPAN> (Programming with Purpose I: Data-Centric Computing) or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CMSC131</SPAN> (Object-Oriented Programming I) or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CMSC133</SPAN> (Object-Oriented Programming I Beyond Fundamentals) or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">INST 326</SPAN> (Object-Oriented Programming)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CMSC142</SPAN> (Programming with Purpose II: Data Structures and Algorithms) or <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CMSC132</SPAN> (Object-Oriented Programming II)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">MATH140</SPAN> (Calculus I) 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Additionally, a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all courses taken at the University of Maryland and other institutions is required. Transfer applicants undergo a selective review process considering academic performance, co-curricular activities, computing-related research experience or personal projects, and college-level honors and awards. Completion of Gateway requirements does not guarantee admission.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00073300000000000000">
Internal Transfer (Current UMD Students)</A>
</H3>
Current University of Maryland students wishing to change their major to <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> or add it as a second major must:

<OL>
<LI>Successfully complete the Gateway requirements listed above.
</LI>
<LI>Apply through the LEP application available after the add/drop deadline each semester.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Admission is selective, and meeting the Gateway criteria does not ensure acceptance. Students should be prepared to select an alternate major if not admitted to <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL>.  There is too much overlap between computer science and <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> to allow double majoring, so students wishing to switch between them would also need to file for an internal transfer.

<P>

<H3><A ID="SECTION00073400000000000000">
LEP Policies</A>
</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Only one Gateway or performance review course may be repeated to earn the required grade, and it may only be repeated once. A grade of &ldquo;W&rdquo; is considered an attempt.
</LI>
<LI>Students may apply only once to an LEP.
</LI>
<LI>Students directly admitted who fail to meet performance review criteria will be dismissed from the major and may not reapply.
</LI>
<LI>A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 must be maintained after admission; failure to do so will result in dismissal.
</LI>
<LI>Appeals can be made in writing to the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences advising office.
</LI>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00074000000000000000">
Factors Considered in Developing the Proposed Curriculum</A>

The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence is needed to address increasing demand in <SMALL>AI</SMALL> skills and to ensure that those skills are taught early enough in an undergraduate curriculum so that they can be applied across disciplines.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00075000000000000000">
Recruiting and Retaining a Diverse Student Body</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment by integrating and expanding upon existing initiatives within the University of Maryland's computing and information sciences communities. Building upon the successful programs of the Iribe Initiative for Inclusion and Diversity in Computing (I4C), <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will actively participate in and promote activities such as the Mentoring Program, Conference Scholarships, and the Tech&nbsp;+&nbsp;Research initiative (many of the projects there are already <SMALL>AI</SMALL>-centered). These programs have a proven track record of supporting underrepresented students in computing fields by providing mentorship, professional development opportunities, and research experiences. By aligning with these initiatives, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> aims to create a supportive network that encourages the recruitment and retention of a diverse student body.
This supports even before officially admitted to the major, as they are taking gateway courses.

<P>
Furthermore, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will collaborate with diversity and inclusion efforts to ensure that the program's culture reflects a commitment to accessibility and the democratization of information. This collaboration includes participating in outreach programs targeting K-12 students, such as the TRAILS AI Summer Academy, which introduces high school students to artificial intelligence concepts and applications. By engaging with these outreach efforts, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> seeks to inspire a diverse pipeline of future students who are well-prepared and motivated to pursue studies in artificial intelligence. 

<P>
By leveraging and contributing to these established diversity and inclusion programs, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will create an environment that not only attracts a diverse group of students but also provides the necessary support and resources to ensure their success throughout their academic journey.

<H2><A ID="SECTION00081000000000000000">
Relationship to AIM</A>
</H2>

<P>
In Spring 2024, UMD launched the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM), bringing together AI experts across campus to focus on responsible, ethical development and use of the technology to advance public good in industry, government and society. Given the rapid pace of AI development, a core part of AIM’s mission is to reimagine learning in the face of these drastic changes through the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs, including Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees in Artificial Intelligence. Students across all majors will learn the principles of AI and how they apply to their field of study.

<P>
As part of this initiative, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> is designed to be an interdisciplinary program from the
ground up and thus will use faculty with joint appointments with
<SMALL>AIM</SMALL> and homes for courses to create the new interdisciplinary
courses required for this program.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00082000000000000000">
Relationship to Computer Science</A>
</H2>

<P>
This section outlines how <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> would be different from the existing computer science degree (with which is shares multiple courses).  The first, consistent with its inclusion in <SMALL>AIM</SMALL> is that it's interdisciplinary.  Second, it offers an introduction to <SMALL>AI</SMALL> early in students' curriculum.  Finally, it offers another option to help cope with the large demand for computational majors at the University of Maryland.

<P>

<H4><A ID="SECTION00082010000000000000">
Interdisciplinary</A>
</H4>

<P>
At present, the computer science degree (where most students learn the foundations of artificial intelligence) while highly technical, does not require courses in ethics, social issues, or in the foundation of intelligence.
Because Maryland is a world leader in these areas and because <SMALL>AI</SMALL>'s broad impact on society, future leaders in <SMALL>AI</SMALL> will need these softer skills to build effective systems that will benefit society.

<P>
Moreover, the interdisciplinary courses offered by <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will serve as opportunities to bolster the interdisciplinary research that is a fundamental goal of <SMALL>AIM</SMALL>: the coursework and projects that begin in this program can lead to startups, research projects, and synergies across the campus.

<P>

<H4><A ID="SECTION00082020000000000000">
Early Onramp</A>
</H4>

<P>
While there is already an machine learning <SMALL>ML</SMALL> concentration within the computer science degree, <SMALL>AI</SMALL> courses are locked behind long prerequisite chains (the first course in the current <SMALL>ML</SMALL> degree is CMSC 320, and the other <SMALL>AI</SMALL>-relevant courses are all 400 level).  
By integrating <SMALL>AI</SMALL> concepts earlier in the curriculum (starting in the introductory seminar and programming courses), students will be able to see the relevance of <SMALL>AI</SMALL> to their interdisciplinary interests.

<P>

<H4><A ID="SECTION00082030000000000000">
Complementing Existing Computational Majors</A>
</H4>

<P>
There is a large demand for computational majors at the University of Maryland.  
While computer science and information studies are the largest, there are multiple others.

Library Assessment</A>
</H2>

<P>
Attached in full at end of this document, however the conclusion of the assessment is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"With our journal holdings, monographs, and databases, as well as additional support services and resources, at this point in time, our assessment is that the University of Maryland Libraries are able to meet the curricular and research needs of the proposed BS in Artificial Intelligence."

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION000112000000000000000">
Physical Facilities</A>
</H2>

<P>
Short term, most of the instruction will take place in Iribe or the Computer Science Instructional Center (CSIC).  However, a long term plan is for the construction of a new AI-centered building that will house many of the AI-specific courses (although courses shared with CS will remain in Iribe or CSIC).

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION000113000000000000000">
Instructional Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>

<P>

<P>
The BS in AI is expected to grow to an enrollment of 1,200 majors over five years. To teach the required course sections, FTE TTK faculty and FTE PTK faculty will be hired over five years. The new TTK faculty will be recruited with joint appointments between AIM and relevant tenure homes. The new PTK faculty will be hired into the units offering the respective course sections, including computer science, math, information science, and others.

<P>
Because the new program will increase enrollments across multiple units, we are also requesting additional support for Teaching Assistants to support the expected 3000 seats per semester in the fifth year of the program.

<P>
The program will request to receive Differential Tuition to partially offset the cost of Teaching Assistants. Differential Tuition will be routed to AIM, which will use it to fund TAs in the BS in AI under the direction of the Academic Director of the program. Additional Teaching Assistants may be funded by the regular program budget as necessary.

<P>
In addition, we are requesting $788k for expanding the existing Nexus high performance computing cluster for instructional needs and $100k per year to maintain the cluster.  This will:

<UL>
<LI>Provide ObjectStore storage for course projects and interdisciplinary collaboration
</LI>
<LI>Serve locally tuned AI models for applications across the university
</LI>
<LI>Provide GPU allocations for courses to provide instruction on how to develop AI models
</LI>
<LI>Provide CPU allocations for data prepossessing
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Because not all AI models can be run or trained locally on UMD infrastructure, we are also requesting $30k for students to run cloud-based models through the university's existing agreements through providers such as Amazon, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION000114000000000000000">
Administrative and Advising Resources</A>
</H2>

<P>
Based on expected market demand, we project an enrollment of 1,200 in this program after five years. To manage a program of this size, we are requesting one administrative leadership position at the rank of an Assistant Program Director. Academic advising will be provided by a team of five academic advisors including an Assistant Director leading the team. In addition, a full time technical staff member who will coordinate technical resources is needed.

How the Program Relates to the State of Maryland</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION000131000000000000000">
Statewide Need</A>
</H2>

<P>
The establishment of The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence directly aligns with Governor Wes Moore's Executive Order 01.01.2024.02, titled &ldquo;Catalyzing the Responsible and Productive Use of Artificial Intelligence in Maryland State Government&rdquo;. This order emphasizes the need for the State to "ensure the use of AI in Maryland state government is responsible, ethical, beneficial, and trustworthy" and acknowledges that &ldquo;AI is transforming society and work in myriad ways, and the pace of that change will continue to accelerate&rdquo;. 

<P>
By developing a curriculum that emphasizes responsible AI development and ethical considerations, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will prepare technical graduates to contribute to the State's commitment to "fairness and equity" in AI applications. The program's focus on innovation and human-centered design will support the State's goal to "explore ways AI can be leveraged to improve State services and resident outcomes&rdquo;&mdash;one of the many interdisciplinary applications of <SMALL>AI</SMALL> possible with <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL>. Furthermore, by educating students on privacy, safety, security, and the importance of transparency in AI systems, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will help build a workforce capable of upholding the principles outlined in the Executive Order, ensuring that AI technologies are implemented in ways that are &ldquo;valid and reliable&rdquo; and that &ldquo;preserve individuals' privacy rights&rdquo;. 

<P>
In summary, <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> will play a pivotal role in fulfilling the directives of the Executive Order by cultivating a skilled workforce dedicated to the responsible and innovative use of AI, thereby supporting Maryland's mission to "Leave No One Behind" in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. 

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION000132000000000000000">
Demand Analysis</A>
</H2>

<P>
The establishment of The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence is economically justified by the increasing market demand for artificial intelligence (AI) professionals, particularly in the Washington, D.C. region. While computer science (CS) provides a broad foundation in computing principles, AI focuses on creating intelligent systems capable of tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. This specialization aligns with the distinct skill sets employers want in creating training data for models, evaluating AI models, and adapting existing AI models.

<P>
The white paper "From West to the Rest: AI Workforce Trends in the United States," authored by University of Maryland scholars in the Smith School, provides critical insights into the rapidly expanding AI job market. The report highlights that
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stripping out the effects of sheer size, AI Jobs Intensity (ratio of AI to all job postings) yields a different picture. Compared to the aggregated US-level AI Jobs Intensity of 0.56%, Washington DC ranks #1 at 1.75%, followed by VA at 1.36%, with MD not too far behind at 0.83% (p. 5).

</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is attributed to the region's strong emphasis on defense, public sector applications, and private industries increasingly incorporating AI into their operations. Moreover, the paper notes that 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Driving this growth is an all-out embrace of AI by various agencies of the U.S. federal government, including the Department of Defense. As a direct correlate, many of the major equipment, software, and services suppliers to federal agencies and DoD are based in the MD-DC-VA region. These include, among others, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Huntington Ingalls, Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture, and Deloitte. The region is also home to Amazon HQ2 and Capitol One’s corporate HQ (p. 15).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
By situating <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> in this unique economic landscape, the University of Maryland can address a clear market need. The program will prepare graduates with the specialized skills&mdash;natural language processing, generative <SMALL>AI</SMALL>, and how to train and adapt models&mdash;described in the report, positioning them to thrive in industries that are rapidly adopting AI technologies. This alignment with workforce demands underscores the strategic importance of <SMALL>BSAI</SMALL> in supporting the D.C. region's leadership in AI innovation and implementation.

Frequently Asked Questions</A>
</H1>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: Does DATA 250 provide enough of a foundation to satisfy both the linear algebra and discrete math requirements?</SPAN>

<P>
This course is part of the Data Science minor, and it is based on two pre-existing courses: CMSC 250 and
Math 240. One difference is that this is one course instead of two. This course will focus on discrete
mathematics and linear algebra that has applications to data science. 

<P>
There are really two questions here.  

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Does it have enough linear algebra?</SPAN>  For that, the answer is fairly clearly yes.  While it's good to know what a nullity is and being able to do elimination, it's not strictly necessary for the downstream applications in <SMALL>AI</SMALL>.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Does it have enough discrete math?</SPAN>  Here there's a difference of opinion on the committee.  The consensus however is to follow the lead of the data science program (joint between CS and Math) and to accept the less thorough coverage of combinatorics of DATA 250, as it will cover the graph and proof elements of our more traditional discrete math course.  Of course students can always take the CS version, but this would be an additional overall course they'd have to take.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: Will this be an <SMALL>LEP</SMALL>?</SPAN>

<P>
Yes, the intention is to submit as an <SMALL>LEP</SMALL>, although this approval is in parallel to the formal program approval track.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: Why is there no statistics course?</SPAN>

<P>
The committee identified three core skillsets from statistics which are already satisfied in other courses:

<UL>
<LI>Regression: In multiple courses, most notably CMSC 320
</LI>
<LI>Statistical Tests: In the AI Measurement Course
</LI>
<LI>Inference: In the AI Foundation Course
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: What is the relationship between CSAI 221 and CMSC 421?  Are they duplicates?</SPAN>

<P>
In the current proposal, we have currently split out the artificial intelligence foundations course into a higher level one and a lower level one meant for people to take early on in the BS in AI program or as part of some other major.  This is analogous to how Math has a Linear Algebra course for non-majors and one for majors.

<P>
How this would actually be implemented is another question.  Perhaps shared lectures and different recitations and homeworks?  Or two completely different courses?  Bill Regli is revampling CMSC 421, and perhaps this could be part of a larger conversation.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: Many of these upper level courses are likely of interest to existing students.  Will the classes be cross-listed.</SPAN>

<P>
All courses will be crosslisted in relevant departments.  In almost all cases, this will include CS and for the lower-level courses, the BA in AI (HCAI).  We use the CSAI prefix in this proposal to better distinguish new from existing courses.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: Why use Python?  What about CMSC 131, which uses Java?</SPAN>

<P>
The short version is that we want to be ecumenical about the path that students take to get into the program, and it is fine to show that you can program in either Java (via 131) or Python (preferred), feeding into our 142 course that teaches data structures.

<P>
There are several reasons to choose Python: its breadth of packages, its prevalence in the AI arena, and its popularity.  While each of these reasons are intertwined (e.g., its package structure is rich because it is popular), we will address each of these in turn.

<P>
But first, Python has its detractors: syntactic whitespace is odd, the lack of typing teaches bad habits, and an interpreted language does not encourage reasoning about the language.  These are valid criticisms and why we are following David van Horn's innovation of starting not with Python but with Pyret (pronounced like &ldquo;Pirate&rdquo;), a language that is similar to Python but that: it explicitly ends code blocks with a keyword <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">end</SPAN>, has better support for documentation and unit tests, and requires types when defining function arguments.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Packages:</SPAN> Common packages like <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">pandas</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">numpy</SPAN> are designed for Python, and form the backbone of modern data science at <SMALL>AI</SMALL> pipelines.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Prevalaence in AI</SPAN>: Most notably, Pytorch is the most common toolkit for creating new <SMALL>AI</SMALL> models.  As the name implies, it is designed for Python.  

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Popularity:</SPAN> <SMALL>IEEE</SMALL><A ID="tex2html6"
  HREF="#foot861"><SUP><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="footnote.png"></SUP></A> reports that Python remains the top &ldquo;complete&rdquo; programming language in both popularity and in the number of advertised jobs.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: What about articulation with local community colleges?</SPAN>

<P>
We plan to pursue an articulation agreement with a local community college to ensure students can begin the AI program at a community college and finish it in College Park.

<P>
This is still a work in progress, but the relevant courses at MCCC that directly align with many of our early courses are:<A ID="tex2html8"

<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: How will this impact upper-level CS elective enrollments?</SPAN>

<P>
This is complicated and impossible to predict with precision, but it might be helpful to break this into several categories.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lower:</SPAN> For some courses, the material will be covered in new lower-level courses earlier, so only the really interested students would take upper level <SMALL>AI</SMALL> courses (Traditional AI and Neural Networks).  So those courses should see lower enrollments.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Uncertain:</SPAN> For other courses, there are multiple factors at play.  While the increased number of students might increase enrollments (although this is complicated by the CS LEP being more stringent), we are offering many more electives that should distribute the load.  But given this is based on popularity, some courses might see increase enrollments.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Higher:</SPAN> Despite that, for some courses that are now required within a specialization, the enrollments are likely going to be higher (e.g., Natural Language Processing).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
However, one of the primary reasons for the new major is that to hiring more TTK faculty to teach these upper level courses.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: What topics are covered in the <SMALL>AIBS</SMALL> [aibs:216]216 course?</SPAN>

<P>
We plan to roughly follow the outline of https://minitorch.github.io/this course from Sasha Rush but focus more deeply on the lower-level implementation.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The memory hierarchy and latencies

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Q: These are an odd mix of topics for a course, why do they belong together?</SPAN>

<P>
The goal of this course is twofold.  First, students should understand the nuts and bolts of how these models are trained.  Both at the software level&mdash;the abstractions that instantiate abstract functions and generate derivatives from them&mdash;and the hardware level&mdash;how the operations are carried out on the <SMALL>GPU</SMALL>.  But beyond that, students should understand the optimization of these models, which requires other skill sets.  Fortunately, this helps them better understand computer systems.

<P>
There are two ways to optimize a model: make it faster or make it smaller (without sacrificing information).  Making it smaller requires using fewer bits per parameters, which requires understand computer representations of floating point numbers (and the disadvantages of quantization).  Making things faster requires understanding the memory layout of GPUs and how parallel computations can operate on the layout of matrices in GPU memory.

will provide services to local government agencies and small organizations that do not
have the expertise or resources to carry out the evaluation of AI tools that they are
considering using to support their decision-making processes.
The AI Clinic will take on “AI cases” that will be led by one faculty member and by a
group of four students with diverse educational backgrounds. AI cases will provide
semester-long, hands-on learning opportunities for students and will prepare them for
the challenges of AI deployment in real-world settings. The output of the AI cases might
include reports with tool assessments (technical and community-centric) that will be
shared with the agency or organization that requested the case, toolkits for decision
makers on how to carry out their own AI evaluations, or training sessions for decision
makers and small organizations on how to use different types of AI tools, among others. Prereqs: (CSAI 216) AND (CMSC 421 OR CSAI 221)

Tracing the emergence of the concept of disability alongside the rise of racial knowledge since the 19th century, we will consider how disability activists have responded to ableism by developing art, political strategies, and subcultures that promote a more just society built for a wider variety of human bodies. Students will learn about the moral, medical, social, and ecological models of disability; explore varied disability experiences relating to mental illness, chronic disease, and sensory and mobility impairments; debate ethical questions concerning eugenics, selective abortion, health care access, and medical technologies; and analyze the work of disabled artists and activists of color. Students will also discuss principles of universal design which seek to make classrooms more just and collaborative. In order to balance accessibility and community building, the course has been designed for synchronous online instruction complemented by optional in-person sessions.
 Prereqs: (CSAI 216) AND (CMSC 421 OR CSAI 221)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Gender, Race and Computing (WGSS 115)</SPAN>: Race and gender have shaped computing from its earliest histories to contemporary debates over bias in search algorithms, surveillance, and AI. As computational processes shape ever more dimensions of everyday life from the personal to the global scale, understanding how they operate and how power operates within them grows ever more important. Combating racism and sexism is not as simple as ensuring the pool of programmers and engineers is more diverse; structures of power are embedded in digital technologies as they are in all aspects of our society, and we must learn to perceive their operation if we hope to transform them. We will examine how racism and sexism operate in the field of computer science and in everyday uses of digital technologies, while studying how feminist and racial justice movements have created alternative approaches. This class is for anyone who wishes to better understand the relationships between digital technology, structural power, and social justice.
