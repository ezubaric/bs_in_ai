\end{figure*}


  \input{requirements/Core}

\subsection{Interdisciplinary AI Electives}

After completing the core, students can take upper level courses in \ai{} across the curriculum, potentially combining with a minor or certificate.

\input{requirements/Unspecialized}

\subsection{Specialization: Generative AI}

    Students learn how to build and use, train, and evaluate AIs for generating text, images, and other modalities.

  \input{requirements/GenAI}

\subsection{Specialization: AI, Society, and Decision Making}

This specialization equips students with a strong technical foundation in \ai{} emphasizing ethical considerations, policy, and \ai{} in governance and social systems.

\input{requirements/Society}

\subsection{Specialization: AI Algorithms}

This specialization focuses on understanding the various algorithms that are used in AI applications across different modalities and applications.

\input{requirements/Algorithms}

\subsection{Specialization: Accessibility}

This specialization addresses questions of equity and digital accessibility related to AI to develop accessible/assistive technologies to help populations affected by situational disability, injury, age, or congenital conditions.

\input{requirements/Accessible}

\subsection{Specialization: Robotics}

NB: We have not heard back from engineering on this, so this specialization is likely going to not be in the final proposal.  However, we list it here for completeness in case it does make it in. 

\input{requirements/Robotics}

%\subsection{Additional Specializations}

%As AI develops, we will add more specializations (suggestions welcome!).  Of interest are social impact and accessibility.

\section{Frequently Asked Questions}

\input{sections/faq}

  \section{Courses}

In this section, we list the courses used anywhere in the proposal.  The sections are ordered by decreasing changes: new courses first, new courses but already proposed by the \abr{ba} in \abr{ai} (and under development now), followed by existing courses: first those that require slight modifications in delivery of requirements, followed by those used without changes.  

  \subsection{New}

  \input{course_descriptions/New}

  \subsection{New, but Shared with BA in AI}

  Because the BA in AI is under concurrent development, it is not 100\% clear / certain if these courses can be shared, but that is our hope so that courses can be shared and to make it easier to move between majors more easily for students early on.  

  For the sampler courses, the hope is that more will be introduced that can also fulfil general education requirements.

  \input{course_descriptions/Shared}

    \subsection{Lower Level Alternative to Existing Course}

    Because we want to expose students to AI concepts earlier, we are creating sophomore-level courses that cover similar topics to some of our upper-division courses.  These are not replacing those courses (students could get credit only for one of the two), but providing an alternative (much like math has linear algebra for majors and non-majors).

    \input{course_descriptions/Level}

    %\subsection{Breadth Courses}

    %\input{course_descriptions/Breadth}

  \subsection{Refocus}

    Courses already approved and whose material perfectly match the goals of \short{}, but would need to be scaled up.  At the moment, we are also considering allowing the INST introduction to Python (a two course sequence) to substitute for taking CSMC 141.  E.g., students who take the two course INFO programming sequence would be able to continue onto CMSC 142, which focuses on data structures.  The goal is to provide as many pipelines into the program as possible while maintaining rigor.
    
  \input{course_descriptions/Refocus}


    \subsection{Existing, but Need Alternate Prerequisite Structure}

    For courses that require CMSC 216, would allow AI 216 (computational graphs) as an alternative.  For higher-level courses \textbf{NB: These are only AI courses}, we would require AI 221 (AI foundations) instead of CMSC 330 (Organization of Programming Languages).  Of course, the CMSC pathway of 330 would still remain an option.

    \input{course_descriptions/Prereq}

  \subsection{Existing}

    Existing courses mentioned in the proposal are listed here for completeness (and so readers can look up unfamiliar courses).

% \begin{definition}[Gauss] 
% To a mathematician it is obvious that
% $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
% e^{-x^2}\,dx=\sqrt{\pi}$. 
% \end{definition} 

% \begin{theorem}[Pythagoras]
% The square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof} 
% We have that $\log(1)^2 = 2\log(1)$.
% But we also have that $\log(-1)^2=\log(1)=0$.
% Then $2\log(-1)=0$, from which the proof.
